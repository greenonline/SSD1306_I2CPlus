## Single vertical scroll investigation

### Horizontal

Note the bits that *change*, i.e. toggle:

```none
0x26 = 0b100110 - Continuous right
0x27 = 0b100111 - Continuous left
0x2C = 0b101100 - One pixel right
0x2D = 0b101101 - One pixel left
```

The bits that change, from continuous to 1-pixel scroll, are `bit 1` and `bit 3`. 

**Is there a similar change, in a similar pattern, required in order to acheive the *mythical* 1-pixel vertical scroll?**

Note that `bit 0` just changes the direction, left or right for both continuous and 1-pixel horizontal scroll (i.e. `0x26`/`0x27` and `0x2C`/`0x2D`).

### Vertical

#### Unused command bytes that could be candidates

`0x24` and `0x25` would make good candidates, seeing as they are the *only adjascent pair* available, in the byte range that is "local" to the other scroll commands.

```none
#define SSD1306_UNKNOWN_0x24                 0x24
#define SSD1306_UNKNOWN_0x25                 0x25
#define SSD1306_UNKNOWN_0x28                 0x28
#define SSD1306_UNKNOWN_0x2B                 0x2B
```

#### Brainstorming possible bit toggling

```none
0x29 = 0b101001 - Continuous right
0x2A = 0b101010 - Continuous left
0x?? = 0b?????? - One pixel
0x?? = 0b10?0?1 - One pixel
0x23 = 0b100011 - Set fade Blink
0x24 = 0b100100 - One pixel?
0x25 = 0b100101 - One pixel?
0x28 = 0b101000 - ?
0x2B = 0b101011 = ? 
```

Note that, for continuous scrolling, whilst the toogling `bit 0` still changes direction (left/right), the order is reversed, as `bit 1` *also* toggles upon a direction change from right to left.


Taking `0x24` and `0x25`, assuming that left and right maintain the same, or reversed, bit order of `bit 1` and `bit 0`, then the bits that change, from continuous to single scroll, would be `bit 2`, and `bit 3` - which, at least, *seems* plausible.

```none
0x29 = 0b101001 - Continuous right
0x2A = 0b101010 - Continuous left
0x24 = 0b100100 - One pixel (left/right)?
0x25 = 0b100101 - One pixel (left/right)?
```

All that remains to test this, is to implement a new method:

 - `setupScrollHVOne()`


Unfortunately, when tested, commands `0x24` and `0x25` did *not* scroll the display at all. Maybe some other currently unused bytes would work instead? Or, maybe, some other prior, or additional, configuration is required, i.e. more command or data bytes are required - in order to get `0x24` and `0x25` (or whatever the corrent command byte values are) to scroll.  Further testing is ongoing.

### Assumption

The idea behind trying to second guess how bit manipulation affects the scrolling, is based upon the assumption that the driver IC uses various bits to trigger certain functions - as is often the case in rudementary logic ICs. However, if the driver IC is using a variation of micro-code then all bets are off and the command byte values could just have been chosen at random - meaning that the individual bits themselves have no particular significance on affecting functionality changes.

If it is is indeed the case, that micro-code is employed, then the 1-pixel vertical (diagonal) scroll functionality might not have even been implemented. Maybe the 1-pixel horizontal code functioning is just a lucky fluke.

It *is* strange that the 1-pixel horizontal scroll is *consistantly* undocumented, from v1.1 to v1.5 of the data sheet. Was it done on purpose? If so, why? Is the implementation a bit flakey, and becaause of that it was quietly dropped?
